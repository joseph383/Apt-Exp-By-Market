# Apt-Exp-By-Market
This project allows someone to upload commercial apartment financial expenses into a database to later calculate the average expenses in a specific real estate market (tampa, dallas, etc) by expense category (insurance, payroll, etc)
The data is entered into a form which is then stored in a Mysql database. 
The user can edit a property's expenses (as more updated financials become available each month).
The user can generate a market report that will calculate the average market expense line items in a per-door basis and total per door basis for overall expenses in a given market.

This information is helpful to the investor because they can use this data to compare against a current property they are analyzing and see if the seller's financials look too good to be true or if they are higher than market averages and there may be an opportunity to create value by lowering expenses.
